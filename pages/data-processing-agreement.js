                    information is actually available to Omnisend and Customer does not otherwise have access to such information, 
                    Omnisend will provide reasonable assistance to Customer with any data protection impact assessments, and prior 
                    consultations with Supervisory Authorities, which Customer reasonably considers to be required by the Data Protection 
                    Laws, in each case solely in relation to Omnisend’s processing of Customer Personal Data.

                request to the extent able and only as required by the applicable Data Protection Laws.

                    <br></br>
                5.2. If a request from a Data Subject exercising their Data Subject rights is made directly to Omnisend, Omnisend will, 
                to the extent permitted by applicable law, inform Customer thereof and will advise Data Subjects to submit their request 
                to Customer. Customer shall be solely responsible for responding to any such Data Subject requests.

                    <br></br>
                5.3. If a Data Subject brings a claim directly against Omnisend for a violation of its Data Subject rights, Customer 
                will indemnify Omnisend for any cost, charge, damages, expenses or loss arising from such a claim, to the extent 
                Omnisend has notified Customer about the claim and given Customer the opportunity to cooperate with Omnisend in the 
                defense and settlement of the claim.

                degradation of the overall security of the Services provided to Customer.

                Data when in transit to and from the Services, and taking any appropriate steps to securely encrypt or backup any Customer

                7.1. Omnisend will maintain all appropriate records of Processing carried out in respect of Customer Personal Data in 
                accordance with this DPA as well as with the applicable Data Protection Laws (the “Records”). Omnisend shall, in 
                accordance with the Data Protection Laws and in response to a reasonable, lawful written request by Customer, make 
                available to Customer information in Omnisend’s possession or control related to Omnisend’s compliance with the Data

                7.2. To the extent required pursuant to GDPR, Customer may, upon 30 days’ prior written request and no more than once 
                per calendar year unless otherwise required by applicable law, during regular business hours, without interrupting 
                Omnisend’s business operations, and subject to Omnisend’s onsite confidentiality and security procedures and policies, 
                conduct an inspection of the relevant portions of the Records for the sole purposes of assessing Customer’s compliance 
                with GDPR and assessing Omnisend’s compliance with its obligations under this DPA. Subject to Processor’s approval, 
                which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the foregoing right may be exercised on Customer’s behalf by a qualified 
                third party auditor. Access by any third party auditor shall be subject to such auditor’s agreement to confidentiality 
                obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in the Agreements with respect to Confidential Information, 
                provided that all such Records and information may be disclosed to Customer.

                    <br></br>
                8.2. Omnisend shall maintain an up-to-date list of its Sub-Processors, which is available to Customer upon request. 
                Omnisend shall notify Customer if it adds or removes Sub-Processors at least 10 days prior to any such changes if 
                Customer opts in to receive such notifications by subscribing here. Within such 10-day period, Customer can object to 
                the addition of a proposed Sub-Processor on the basis that such addition would cause Customer to violate applicable legal 
                requirements.  Customer’s objection shall be in writing and include Customer’s specific reasons for its objection and 
                options to mitigate, if any. If Customer does not object within such 10-day period, the proposed Sub-Processor may be 
                commissioned to Process Customer Personal Data. If Customer objects to the addition of a Sub-Processor in accordance 
                with this Section 8.2 and Omnisend cannot reasonably accommodate Customer’s objection, Omnisend will notify Customer. 
                Customer may terminate the affected services by providing Omnisend with a written notice within one (1) month of the

                that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent 
                applicable to the nature of the service provided by such Sub-Processor; and (ii) remain responsible for such 
                Sub-Processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-Processor 
                that cause Omnisend to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

                    9.1. Where the performance of the Services involves a transfer of Customer Personal Data outside the EEA, Omnisend will 
                    take such steps as may be required to ensure there is adequate protection for such Customer Personal Data in accordance 
                    with the applicable Data Protection Laws, which may include entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses. The Standard 
                    Contractual Clauses will apply to Customer Personal Data that is transferred outside the EEA, either directly or via 
                    onward transfer, to any country not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection 
                    for personal data (as described in the GDPR). The Standard Contractual Clauses will not apply to Customer Personal Data 
                    that is not transferred, either directly or via onward transfer, outside the EEA. By agreeing to this DPA, Customer is 
                    entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses with Omnisend. In addition, by agreeing to this DPA, Customer is entering 
                    into the Standard Contractual Clauses with Omnisend’s Sub-Processors established outside either the EEA or countries 
                    considered by the European Commission to have adequate protection.

                    <br></br>
                    9.2. If Customer notifies Omnisend in writing about another Controller and Omnisend does not object within thirty (30) 
                    days after Customer’s notification, Customer agrees on behalf of such other Controller(s), or if unable to agree, will 
                    procure agreement of such Controller(s), to be additional data exporter(s) of the Standard Contractual Clauses concluded 
                    between Omnisend and Customer.  Customer agrees and, if applicable, procures the agreement of other Controllers that the 
                    Standard Contractual Clauses, including any claims arising from them, are subject to the terms set forth in the 
                    Agreements, including the exclusions and limitations of liability.

                    <br></br>
                    9.3. To the extent Customer and Omnisend are relying on a specific statutory mechanism to normalize international data 
                    transfers and that mechanism is subsequently revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, Customer 
                    and Omnisend agree to cooperate in good faith to pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the 
                    transfer.

                The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.
                The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
                The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.

                <br></br>
                Obligations of the data exporter
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The data exporter agrees and warrants:
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (a)    that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be 
                carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, 
                has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not 
                violate the relevant provisions of that State;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (b)    that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data 
                importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter’s behalf and in accordance with the applicable 
                data protection law and the Clauses;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (c)    that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security 
                measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (d)    that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are 
                appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, 
                unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, 
                and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the 
                risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the 
                cost of their implementation;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (e)    that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (f)    that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed 
                before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing 
                adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (g)    to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 
                8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the 
                suspension;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (h)    to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, 
                and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has 
                to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case 
                it may remove such commercial information;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (i)    that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a 
                subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the 
                data importer under the Clauses; and
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                (j)    that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    Clause 5

                    Obligations of the data importer
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    The data importer agrees and warrants:
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (a)    to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and 
                    the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter 
                    of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or 
                    terminate the contract;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (b)    that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the 
                    instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a 
                    change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations 
                    provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which 
                    case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (c)    that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before 
                    processing the personal data transferred;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (d)    that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (i)    any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise 
                    prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement 
                    investigation,
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (ii)    any accidental or unauthorised access, and
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (iii)    any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been 
                    otherwise authorised to do so;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (e)    to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the 
                    personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the 
                    processing of the data transferred;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (f)    at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing 
                    activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of 
                    independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, 
                    selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (g)    to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for 
                    subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such 
                    commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the 
                    security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (h)    that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior 
                    written consent;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (i)    that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (j)    to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>

                    Liability
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                        The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations 
                        referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from 
                        the data exporter for the damage suffered.
                        If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against 
                        the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their 
                        obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or 
                        ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a 
                        claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the 
                        entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject 
                        can enforce its rights against such entity.
                        <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                        If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in 
                        paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 
                        3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to 
                        exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against 
                        the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data 
                        exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data 
                        exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its 
                        rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations 
                        under the Clauses.
                        <br></br>

                <br></br>
                        The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or 
                        claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:
                        <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (a)    to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                    (b)    to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
                    <br></br>
                <br></br>
                        The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

                <br></br>
                        The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so 
                        requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
                        The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, 
                        and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an 
                        audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
                        The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it 
                        or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to 
                        paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

                    The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on 
                    business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

                Subprocessing
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
    The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the 
    Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the 
    Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which 
    imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor 
    fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the 
    data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s obligations under such agreement.
    The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as 
    laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of 
    Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have 
    become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract 
    or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the 
    Clauses.
    The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed 
    by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
    The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer 
    pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data 
    protection supervisory authority.

            <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

                <br></br>

            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Security Measures
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            This document constitutes the Security Measures annex (the “Security Annex”) of the Omnisend Data Processing Agreement (the “DPA”). The Security Annex is stated at a relatively high level and Customer recognizes that the Security Annex may be revised by Omnisend from time to time. All terms used and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the DPA.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            HUMAN RESOURCES SECURITY
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend has implemented and maintains appropriate measures to ensure that authorized employees involved in the processing of Customer Personal Data are authorized with a need to access the data, are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations and have undergone appropriate training in the protection and handling of Customer Personal Data. Omnisend employees operate primarily “in the cloud” and treat local storage on computing devices as ephemeral.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend ensures that access to Customer Personal Data is revoked immediately upon termination or when access is no longer required for personnel involved in the processing of Customer Personal Data.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            PHYSICAL SECURITY
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Policies and procedures, and supporting business processes, are in place for maintaining a safe and secure working environment in Omnisend’s offices and controlling physical access, including access provisioning.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            The Services rely on the Google Cloud Platform who is responsible for implementing controls for physical security of data center facilities, backup media, and other physical systems, providing comprehensive and state-of-the-art security capabilities (available at https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design/resources/google_infrastructure_whitepaper_fa.pdf).
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            ACCESS CONTROL
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend has implemented and maintains access control processes and mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Personal Data and to limit access only to authorized employees with a business need to know.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Upon termination of personnel, whether voluntary or involuntary, the security team will follow Omnisend’s personnel exit procedure, which includes revocation of the associated user account and reclamation of company-owned devices, office keys or access cards, and all other corporate equipment and property prior to the final day of employment.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            EVENT LOGGING AND MONITORING
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Log files and audit trails will be maintained (for as long as required under applicable law) and regularly reviewed to detect and respond to events concerning activities on the Services.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            NETWORK SECURITY
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            The Services rely on the Google Cloud Platform who is responsible for implementing data center network security providing comprehensive and state-of-the-art security capabilities (available at https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design/resources/google_infrastructure_whitepaper_fa.pdf).
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend ensures that firewalls, network routers, switches, load balancers, domain name servers, mail servers, and other network components of the network infrastructures under its control and management responsibility are configured and secured in accordance with commercially reasonable industry standards.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            REMOTE ACCESS
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend has implemented and maintains remote access policies and procedures that meet or exceed industry standards for Omnisend personnel who require remote access to a network or system that protects, processes or stores Customer Personal Data.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            PROTECTION FROM DATA LOSS, CORRUPTION
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            All databases are kept separate and dedicated to prevent corruption and overlap. Omnisend has implemented logic that segregates user accounts from each other.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            DATA DESTRUCTION
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend relies on the Google Cloud Platform for data destruction and can only perform logical deletion. Deleted Customer Personal Data is rendered unreadable or disabled by the Google Cloud Platform and the underlying storage areas on the Google Cloud Platform network that were used to store the content are wiped, prior to being reclaimed and overwritten, in accordance with the Google Cloud Platform standard policies and deletion timelines available at: https://cloud.google.com/security/deletion.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER RECOVERY
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
            Omnisend services hosted in the Google Cloud Platform shall be configured in such a manner so as to withstand long-term outages to a Google Cloud Platform Availability Zone. Controls such as automated replication may be used to achieve this desired level of availability.
            <br></br>
                <br></br>
